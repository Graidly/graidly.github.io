            LecturaLM capstone project focuses on developing an advanced Automated Grading and Feedback system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in evaluating university quizzes, midterms, and finals. Inspired by recent innovations, our system will incorporate rubric generation, accurate grading, and post-assessment feedback. The app will ensure consistent, fair, and unbiased results, providing personalized feedback to enhance student learning. Operating on a local server, the system will integrate a human-in-the-loop review process with instructors and TAs, streamlining the grading workload while maintaining high accuracy and fairness.
